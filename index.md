## Shaders
### Wet Floor and Ripple Shader

Scene Transition Effect is a complex effect composed of 4 parts:

 1. Outline shader(Inverted Hull method +  Postprocessing method) 
 2. Outline on occlusion
 3. Power shield effect 
 4. Postprocessing effect: glitch + chromatic splitting
 5. URP render feature

### Fake Interior Shader

Fake Interior Shader can save performance by only drawing the window without drawing the full interior.

Dissolve with direction.
Cheap semi-transparent silhouette effect with correct sorting.

### HDRP Toon Shader
To make high quality cutscenes, we changed the pipeline from URP to HDRP. I was responsible for implementing character shader in HDRP based on URP character shader.

An HDRP Custom Pass was also made for high-fidelity hair shadow.

### Substance Painter and Maya Shader
To keep consistency between the render results in Unity and DCC software, both scene and character shaders were re-written in DCC software. Work environment was also configured to match Unity.
